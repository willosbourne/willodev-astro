Going into 2026 and reflecting on all of 2025, I think I've settled on a [yearly theme](https://www.themesystem.com) of Stability. Between buying a home in 2025, and my position at work changing to be more of a team lead, and a million other small things, last year had a whole lot of change. I'm sure this coming year will bring more, too, but what I'm choosing to focus myself on is making sure everything is stable, and providing a good foundation to build upon. 

Some of the outcomes that I want to see from this year is just a better handle on the day-to-day tasks that make everything else possible. A clean house, a well organized work day, and a health body. Taking this year to really set a foundation for everything that comes next seems like the best thing I can do, and after all the change from last year, I just want to get my feet back under me, and start moving forward with a good base.

Something that doesn't totally fit into the theme, but that I still have a general goal towards is being more outwardly expressive online. I love finding folks blogs online and just getting to read through their backlog and get bits of their personality, and I want to be able to contribute to that version of the internet that I love as well. Again, a bit off topic to the "theme", but the way I'll justify it is this is something I want to do for a long time, so setting a stable base for me to work on it overtime is still looking to generate that long term stability this whole year is about.
