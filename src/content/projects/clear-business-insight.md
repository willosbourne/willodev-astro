Clear Business Insight is a project I've worked on, and grown to lead at Seven Hills Technology.

Originally, this was long-in-the-tooth custom software for running our clients primary business. As it grew overtime,
more local business owners were impressed by the utility of the software. Our client's drive to deliver this product 
matched well with Seven Hills Technology's partnership focus, and we've brought this app to new modern tech stack and
opened up the core value of the product to a broad group of local entrepreneurs. 

We bring the original tenants of the legacy software to a new Software as a Service focused light, and enable a stable
codebase to build on for years to come.
