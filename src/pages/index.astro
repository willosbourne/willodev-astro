        focused on working with his clients and solving their problems.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        In his free time, Will is probably spending time with his wife & cats, reading fantasy novels,
        planning for his D&D campaign, or any number of other mini hobbies that grab him at the time
        (woodworking, video games, writing, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
        If it's early in the morning, you might find him running in all around the east side of Cincy,
        and if it's late, he may be in the backyard enjoying a local craft beer by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exploring technical concepts that he can't dive deep into through work often centers around his
        home server. Working with new technology (or specifically without it, embracing the foundational web platform)
        is always a pleasant outlet, often self hosting his experiments to stay comfortable with what the cloud can
        often hide.
